## About Me

Hey, I'm Paul. I'm currently a Frontend Engineer at <a href="https://www.mindsdb.com">MindsDB</a>. We're building a platform that makes it easy for enterprises to connect, unify, and query their data using AI. Mostly I work with React, Typescript, and TailwindCSS.

Outside of our own product,  I'm pretty excited about <a href="https://tanstack.com/">Tanstack</a>, the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/">Cloudflare developer platform</a>, <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a>, and AI more broadly. Feel free to connect with me using one of the links.
